This repository contains the example code for the [Functional Components
](https://vueschool.io/courses/functional-components) course on [Vue School](https://vueschool.io).

Learn how to improve your Vue.js applications by utilizing the full power of functional components. Functional components are "slimmer" than classic Vue.js components. Thus they perform better.

Functional components are a great tool to have in your Vue.js toolbelt. They are especially handy if you render hundreds or thousands of component instances in one page, where each component is responsible for displaying data.

In this course, you'll learn everything you need to know about functional components, including when to use them, when not to use them, and their caveats.

We will also cover render functions and how to use functional components with slots.
